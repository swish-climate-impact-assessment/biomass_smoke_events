* TODO-List
** TODO this needs to pick out a lot of stuff from the manuscript on the R package Repo, I am seperating the R pack (tools) from this repo (data and report/manuscript)
** TODO the URL for install.R (also this is security risk)
** TODO make protocol landing page invite users to 
a) Johnston, b) Farhad, c) bare minimun and d) suggest their own
bare min is just
step 1 get any reference
step 2 get as much bibliographical as possible e.g. author, title, publisher, year, URL, date Accessed
step 3 go to web2py data entry form 
** TODO make downloaded version not require log in
** TODO decommission ANU site, make all references to the github, make landing page that says go to github
** TODO landing page "to enter new data go and register in top right"  remove email ivan.
this becomes dot 5, dot 4 becomes manuscript flesh out dot 
say step 1 register
step 2 add a reference [at this link]
step 3 add dates [at this link]

** TODO add a reference
source is compulsory, authors is optional
title compulsory
volume optional
general location means geographical location? optional? remove this.
Desirable URL (e.g. doi or weblink of any kind and date accessed)
  also you might want to add the folder location on your computer and the file name
optional summary (this is what you think of it)
optional abstract (this is the author thought of it)
spell it out somewhere that you can sort descending by clicking ID (twice)
then the 'biomass smoke events' link is where to go to Add an Event.

Adding events
TODO how to add a new place?
- place add an Other option
- then under that is a free text place.

min date, start date?
max date, end date?
no this is ok

make it clear what is compulsory

final step is to email Ivan.
and if not that is fine but the expectation is to cite the data (the github)

** TODO C:/Temp is temporary, suggest the user move these before they start.
instruction to go into project folder and double click the w2p.cmd
you can go to events page, at bottom export to csv
last step go to github, either submit pull request or see Ivan's current email address, send him a zipped version of the web2py folder along with any supporting data or other material

** TODO the github landing page needs edit
