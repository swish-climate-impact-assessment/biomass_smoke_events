* TODO-List
** TODO this needs to pick out a lot of stuff from the manuscript on the R package Repo, I am seperating the R pack (tools) from this repo (data and report/manuscript)
** TODO the URL for install.R (also this is security risk)
** TODO make protocol landing page invite users to 
a) Johnston, b) Farhad, c) bare minimun and d) suggest their own
bare min is just
step 1 get any reference
step 2 get as much bibliographical as possible e.g. author, title, publisher, year, URL, date Accessed
step 3 go to web2py data entry form 
** TODO make downloaded version not require log in
** TODO decommission ANU site, make all references to the github, make landing page that says go to github
** TODO landing page "to enter new data go and register in top right"  remove email ivan.
this becomes dot 5, dot 4 becomes manuscript flesh out dot 
say step 1 register
step 2 add a reference [at this link]
step 3 add dates [at this link]

** TODO add a reference
source is compulsory, authors is optional
title compulsory
volume optional
general location means geographical location? optional? remove this.
Desirable URL (e.g. doi or weblink of any kind and date accessed)
  also you might want to add the folder location on your computer and the file name
optional summary (this is what you think of it)
optional abstract (this is the author thought of it)
spell it out somewhere that you can sort descending by clicking ID (twice)
then the 'biomass smoke events' link is where to go to Add an Event.

Adding events
TODO how to add a new place?
- place add an Other option
- then under that is a free text place.

min date, start date?
max date, end date?
no this is ok

make it clear what is compulsory

final step is to email Ivan.
and if not that is fine but the expectation is to cite the data (the github)

** TODO C:/Temp is temporary, suggest the user move these before they start.
instruction to go into project folder and double click the w2p.cmd
you can go to events page, at bottom export to csv
last step go to github, either submit pull request or see Ivan's current email address, send him a zipped version of the web2py folder along with any supporting data or other material

** TODO the github landing page needs edit
* manuscript
** TODO go manuscript run-able R

  _Abstract_
  
  ,**Background**: Epidemiological studies of the health effects of
  biomass smoke events (such as bushfires or wood-heater smoke spikes due
  to inversion layers) have been hindered by the lack of available
  datasets that explicitly list the locations and dates of pollution
  events from these sources. Extreme air pollution events may also be
  caused by dust storms, fossil fuel induced smog events or factory fires,
  and so validation is necessary to ensure the events are from biomass
  sources. This paper presents an extensible database developed by the
  authors to identify historical spikes in air pollution and to evaluate
  whether they were caused by vegetation fire smoke or by other possible
  sources. The ability for this database to be extended by other
  researchers means that new events can be added, and new information for
  already identified events can be described. These methods provide a
  systematic framework for retrospective identification of the air quality
  impacts of biomass smoke. In this paper, we describe the database and
  data aquisition methods, as well as analytical considerations when
  validating historical events using a range of reference types.
  
  ,**Methods**: Several major urban centers and smaller regional towns
  in the Australian states of New South Wales, Western Australia, and
  Tasmania were selected as they are intermittently affected by extreme
  episodes of vegetation fire smoke. Air pollution data was collated and
  missing values were imputed. Extreme values were identified and a range
  of sources of reference information were assessed for each date.
  Reference types included online newspaper archives, government and
  research agency records, satellite imagery and a Dust Storms database.
  
  ,**Results**: This dataset contains validated events of extreme
  biomass smoke pollution across Australian cities. The authors have
  previously demonstrated the utility of this database in analyses of
  hospital admissions and mortality data for these locations to quantify
  the pollution-related health effects of these events.
  
  ,**Conclusions**: The database was created using open source
  software and this makes the prospect for future extensions to the
  database possible. This is because if other scientists notice an
  ommision or error in these data they can offer an amendment. We believe
  that this will improve the database and benefit the whole biomass smoke
  health research community.

  \section{Epidemiological studies of outdoor air
  pollution}\label{epidemiological-studies-of-outdoor-air-pollution}
  
  For decades, researchers have studied the public health impacts of
  ambient outdoor air pollution, particularly from the effects of
  particulate and gaseous pollutants, especially associated with the
  combustion of coal, petroleum and biomass used for cooking (Pope \&
  Dockery 2006). Far fewer studies have examined the effect of
  intermittent smoke from biomass burning, such as that which occurs in
  bushfires, or from woodsmoke trapped by inversion layers during winter
  months as wood is burned for heating (Naeher \emph{et al.} 2007).
  
  There is a gap in the epidemiological literature of health effects from
  ambient outdoor air pollution relating to smoke from biomass burning
  such as that from bushfires or woodsmoke from heating. Most literature
  available that focuses on biomass smoke health impacts looks at indoor
  pollution from cooking (Smith 1993). Particles (and perhaps noxious
  gases) in outdoor pollution from biomass smoke might directly influence
  the respiratory system through their inhalation and lodgement in the
  lungs. Particles may then affect the cardiovascular system after their
  entry into the circulatory system from the alveolae. Indirect effects on
  mental health and wellbeing are also plausible.
  
  Epidemiological studies that investigate the relationship between health
  and air pollution exposures have primarily used time-series methods that
  study variations of some health outcomes such as deaths or
  hospitalisations from specific disease groups (Peng \& Dominici 2008).
  These outcomes are usually monitored by day across whole cities, and
  relationships with atmospheric variables estimated in regression models.
  These typically focus on daily levels of ambient air pollution measured
  by a network of monitoring sites scattered across a city, time matched
  to the health outcomes on the same day or a few days after. In general
  biomass smoke forms only a small part of the mixture of pollutants in
  the air, however when a bushfire or inversion layer event occurs there
  is often a concomitant spike in the pollution levels primarily composed
  of biomass smoke. There is then the ability to study statistical
  associations between these pollution spikes and the health outcomes
  around those days. Anomalous levels of pollution can be arbitrarily
  defined using a threshold such as the 95th percentile and these might be
  assumed to be biomass smoke days, however there are other events that
  might cause such as spike such as dust storms, factory fires or even sea
  salt being driven by certain wind events. There is a need then to
  validate the dates on which events are ascribed in any correlational
  study of pollution spikes and health that claims the high levels are due
  to biomass smoke.
  
  \section{The development of this biomass smoke events
  database}\label{the-development-of-this-biomass-smoke-events-database}
  
  This open and extensible database was developed by the authors to
  identify historical spikes in particulate matter concentrations and to
  evaluate whether they were caused by vegetation fire smoke or by other
  means. A summary of the protocol for developing this database and a
  summary of the data we collated is published already as a descriptive
  paper (Johnston \emph{et al.} 2011). This paper describes how the
  database has been extended to be able to be distributed in an open,
  extensible format that allows the research community to add to the
  history of these events.
