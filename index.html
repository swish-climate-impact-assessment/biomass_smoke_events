        <h3>The Biomass Smoke Validated Events Database.</h3>

<p>This dataset contains validated events of extreme biomass smoke pollution across Australian cities. 
If you notice an error in these data please suggest a change with a 'pull request'.  We believe that this will improve the data through community error checking and benefit the whole biomass smoke health research community.</p>
