Biomass Smoke Events Database
=============================


This database is for creating and extending a list of validated bushfire smoke events in Australian cities.

License: CC BY 4.0, see REFERENCES section below for citations

Please contribute your validated events data back to the Extreme Weather Events collaboration.

# Installation instructions

- Download web2py.  This runs on windows, linux and mac.  It requires no installation, just unzip the files to the location you want to work on the biomass smoke databse (e.g. `MyDocuments/projects/bushfires` or something)
- Clone or Download this github repo as a zip
- put the files within this repo into the `applications/biomass_smoke_events_db` folder of your web2py downloaded folder
- run the `web2py` program as per the instructions for your OS
- use a web browser to visit the local website `http://127.0.0.1:8000/biomass_smoke_events_db` (note that the port:8000 used in the example here can change depending on how you start web2py)
- you have to register so that you can enter data (this is a default setting of web2py apps)
- the references are added first, and then the events that reference validates are added
- Alternatively there are instructions on how to use R to do the download and install the Web2py database software and this app here: [https://github.com/swish-climate-impact-assessment/biomass_smoke_events_db/blob/master/static/install.R](https://github.com/swish-climate-impact-assessment/biomass_smoke_events_db/blob/master/static/install.R)


# Using R codes

- The database is designed to be used with R
- This is the best way to import new air pollution data and calculate events using the associated R package [https://github.com/swish-climate-impact-assessment/BiosmokeValidatedEvents](https://github.com/swish-climate-impact-assessment/BiosmokeValidatedEvents)

#### Simple instructions for R interface:
```r
library(RSQLite)  
drv <- dbDriver("SQLite")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "path/to/web2py/applications/biomass_smoke_events_db/databases/storage.sqlite")

# GET BUSHFIRE SMOKE EVENTS TIME SERIES
qc  <- dbGetQuery(con , "select * from biomass_smoke_reference")
str(qc)
qc2  <- dbGetQuery(con , "select * from biomass_smoke_event")

# GET POLLUTION DATA
extract_obs <- dbGetQuery(ch, "select * 
from combined_pollutants")
str(extract_obs)
table(extract_obs$site)
```

Please see the R script in folder `static/get_events_and_timeseries.R` for a worked example.
